Improving organizational performance can be achieved through business process redesign (BPR). When it comes to modern work practices, organizations must often redesign their processes to keep up. This is where enterprise software comes in, offering a common data infrastructure that enables different parts of the organization to access all necessary financial data. The architecture of network accounting business process is divided into three layers. The core layer lies in the enterprise LAN that it can integrate six business processes information into one unity of financial information and non-financial information, including purchasing, inventory, production, sales, finance and customer service, and it can generate flexibly a variety of accounting statements to meet fully the information users’ demands by providing more complete and more valuable related information. The second layer lies in Intranet among enterprises based on the core layer that it can support the link of business processes and the inter-sharing of information among node enterprises of SCM and other external enterprises. The third layer lies in Internet based on the second layer that it can fit society, enterprise and individual together, the specific lays the solid foundation of business collaboration, remote management, online management and centralized management. The operating mechanisms of the network accounting business processes are as follows. When the business event occurs, the probe can get the event information in real-time and the result is stored in the database. Meanwhile, the drive controller can control the business events in real-time by gaining control criteria and standards from database. In case the standard is exceeded, the event is not allowed to occur. Enterprise’ business staff or external personnel can output automatically the required results through report tools if they had the reading authority. Supported the information system and optimizing processes, the managers can directly use the business event information, criteria and standards to control, guide, regulate and restrict management and operation in real-time, improving operation efficiency and effect. The enterprise can share the accounting information with node enterprises of SCM to bring about JIT that improve the core competitiveness of enterprise. This helps them to function more efficiently, cut costs, enhance customer service, and minimize the risk of human errors. Justifying projects has become increasingly crucial as information systems become more expensive and vital to organizations. IT can pursue two distinct goals: lowering operating costs or improving productivity, based on the difference between operational effectiveness and strategic positioning.

                      This is the age of industrial transformation that is being driven by the Internet of Things (IoT). It offers very unique chance to maximize productivity excellence and foster economic expansion while having the opportunity to meet environmental concerns. This comprehensive study looks into not only the IoT contribution to energy efficiency and cost reduction but also potential use in areas of administrative operations with the same objective of energy efficiency and cost reduction. With the aid of rigorous mixed methods research that brings together qualitative data from multiple industries, against the backdrop of carefully selected case studies showing the actual benefits of IoT installations, the paper seeks to give a clear picture of the practical advantages of IoT-powered organizations. The research presents information regarding how IoT technologies function to optimize energy applications, enhance processes, and cut down waste through their ability to collect data in real-time and manage systems. Besides, it will analyze the problems companies may run into while adding IoT solutions, such as technological complexity, initial expenditure, and security matters. On the other hand, the research also designs the tactical moves that the companies can opt for as an alternative to completely eradicate these barriers and successfully deploy the IoT technology. Through the systematic study of the role of the Internet of Things on green business practices policymakers, business leaders, and technologists will gain valuable insights which can be applied in whatever levels they are working from. This policy is based on a systematic approach to IoT adoption, which, inter alia, suggests the organization of the project, statistical analysis, and improvement of the present situation to get the best economic and environmental state of affairs. This will further the comprehension of the power of IoT technology in both developing sustainability and increasing profitability, all indications that it is not just a technological advantage but rather a basic instrument for the future sustainability of business practices.

                        To illustrate, the Internet of Things (IoT) has done an excellent job of changing the way business organizational decisions are made by making data available in unimaginable magnitudes. The following paper aims to identify and explain how IoT, with the help of predictive analytics, can improve BI and decision-making. This includes a discussion on several operational and customer cases, consideration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning applications alongside the Internet of Things, and analysis of trends and developments of IoT. These are the core conclusions of IoT importance within real-time business, and related difficulties and tools for the improvement.

                        In an ever-increasingly integrated world of the Internet, the IoT (IoT) and big data analytics are considered fundamental drivers of business transformation, which propel organizations to knowledge and operational efficiency with the new value unlocked. This paper conducts an all-round study of how IoT technologies linked with real-time data analysis can be used to create the norn of the consumer and industrial markets. With precision case studies illustrated, the article shows in an actual fashion how these technologies are used specifically to ease operations, improve the customer's experience and create new innovative models of business. As the next step, it assesses the future revenue streams triggered by these technologies and advocates for the appropriate strategy shift to better harness their potential. IoT and real-time data implementation may create beneficial digital inventories; yet, it comes with a series of obstacles, namely the security and privacy issues. The project makes analyses in which risks are revealed and future prospects are given with possible ways of improving security systems and long-term business conception among other things. It shows the amazing potential of using IoT and real-time data and, at the same time, illustrates the importance for the companies to refine their strategies and be prepared to the situation where emerging technologies are becoming exciting opportunities but also the necessity to be safe and act ethically.

                        Water is a vital element in our environment but day by day water pollution is increasing in an alarming rate in our country. In Bangladesh’s perspective, industries such as textile and ready-made garments (RMG) contribute to a massive amount of waste or effluent. Effluent treatment plant (ETP) are used to remove as much suspended solids from wastewater as possible before it gets back to the environment. However, according to a report published by the Environment and forests ministry, seven state-run factories don’t have any effluent treatment plant (ETP) to treat their waste before disposal. And also even the factories which has ETP do not always keep the ETP up and running because it consumes a lot of electricity. The purpose of our research is to establish a setup which will monitor the real-time quality of water outside the industries and inform us whether the ETP is turned on or not with the help of E-IoT and various classification algorithm. It will also predict the seasonal impact where the ETP might be turned off again and what will be the quality of water with the help of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as CNN, KNN and LSTM. We have also tracking the sensor value for monitoring and the ETP outlet with RGB color analysis. We have successfully achieved an accuracy of 99% for KNN, 97.5% for CNN and 94.9% forecasting model accuracy for LSTM.

                      Disabled people and Virus affected patients can be helped through Internet of Things and Robotic systems in this modern era. Recently the whole world is suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. The virus affected and disabled people are helpless because caregivers, doctors and other people are afraid of the contagious virus. This work will result in an IoT based Robotic agent which will be able to help disabled and virus affected people with low cost systems. The robotic agent will be able to recognize the patient's Gesture and follow instructions through it with 360-degree movement. Without image processing the system is made with MPU 6050 Accelerometer Gyroscope sensor for Gesture Recognition. Radio Frequency communication was used to make the system wireless.
